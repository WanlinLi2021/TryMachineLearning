# TryMachineLearning
I practiced what I have learned from machine learning couses 



Preprocession method: 

step1.Drop variables that have a very low variation (In R)
step2.Drop variables that have a high collinearity(>0.75)(In R)
step3.Backward stepwise selection(stepAIC from the MASS package)(In R)
step4. Drop variables that have a very low correlation with the target	(In Python)
step5. Lasso 
step6. add 6 features (SelectKBest(mutual_info_regression, k=6))(In Python)
	


Outliers Detection (In Python): 

method: DBSCAN Clustering (Density_based spatial clustering of application)
Visualisation: PCA

Model training (In Python)

Dummy (as the baseline)
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso regression
ElasticNet
Partial Least Squares
Polynomial Regression
Neural Networks
K-Nearest Neighbors
